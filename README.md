# Project-3-Titanic-Voyage-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Titanic Voyage Dataset

Objective:

Perform EDA on the Titanic voyage dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights related to passenger survival.

Data Overview:

The dataset includes passenger details such as age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing data, particularly in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Removed irrelevant columns and standardized data types for consistency.

Descriptive Statistics:

Calculated summary statistics for numerical variables such as Age, Fare, and Pclass.
Reviewed the distribution of categorical variables, including Sex, Embarked, and Survived.

Data Visualization:

Plotted distributions of key features such as Age, Fare, and Pclass.
Created bar charts and pie charts to visualize survival rates across different groups (e.g., by gender, passenger class).
Generated heatmaps to identify correlations between features.

Survival Analysis:

Analyzed survival rates based on factors like gender, age, class, and fare.
Discovered that women and children had higher survival rates compared to men.
Noted that passengers in higher classes (e.g., 1st class) had better survival odds.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features, such as FamilySize (combining SibSp and Parch) and Title extracted from passenger names, to explore additional survival predictors.

Conclusion:

The EDA provided valuable insights into the factors affecting passenger survival during the Titanic voyage.
Key findings include the significant impact of gender, passenger class, and age on survival rates.
These insights will guide further analysis and model development to predict survival outcomes with greater accuracy.
